          About Me
        </h2>
        
      <div>
        I am a Computer Science major at Northwestern University hoping to continue on
        to grad school, for a PhD in computer science with a focus on education. I am
        currently an undergraduate TA, helping with the introductory computer science classes
        at Northwestern. I am also a part of YETI(Youth Education Technology for Inclusivity)
        Lab, which is attached to TIDAL Lab at Northwestern. This research is focused on
        constructing educational opportunities for youth to learn about computer science via
        creative and nonconventional avenues. The current curriculum focuses on the  intersection
        of music and computer science using TunePad, a platform that allows users to create music
        with Python.
