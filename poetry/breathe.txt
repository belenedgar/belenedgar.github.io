Breathe

Breathe in and out - that’s all you need to do

But…

Don’t forget to smile
Don’t forget to laugh
Keep the conversation alive
Why’re you so quiet
Are we not enough for you

Don’t forget to look composed
Don’t forget to stay calm
Stay alert
You look tired
Are you even listening

Breathe in and out - it can be a scream or a whisper
Just breathe
