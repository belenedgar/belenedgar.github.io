19 children
19 beautiful innocent children
They will never know what it is to grow old
Never graduate or have kids
But they still experienced life and love and joy
A life regardless the span is precious

19 children
19 children who couldâ€™ve lived 19 more years
Do not let their lives go to waste
Remember them
Advocate for the protection of 19 living children
All life is worth living

2 women
2 loving mothers
They will never say goodbye to their children
Never see their husbands again
But they protected their students to the end
Even if cut short, their impact will be felt

Every life is worthy of protection
These 21 people were not protected
But 21 future generations can be
