Alone in Space

In the blink of an eye, she leapt off the moon
Grasping for something concrete
Only to hit empty space

There will be no rescue mission
In the abyss there is nothing
Only her thoughts as a companion

The jump was made to reach new horizons
But the risk of new discovery
Is loneliness

Embrace the barren landscape
Where there is a blank canvas
There is possibility
