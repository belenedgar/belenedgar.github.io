- 2 cups flour
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/3 cup butter, cold
- 2/3 cup milk
- 2 tbsp lemon juice

1. In a bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt

2. Add chunks of butter into the mixture and use pastry cutter to combine unitl crumbly

3. Mix together milk and lemon juice to make your own buttermilk

4. Combine milk with crumbly flour mixture just until all the flour is combined

5. For lighter flakier biscuits, just grab about 1/4 cup sized balls of dough and plop them on baking tray.
Rolling them out condenses the biscuit and it loses its airiness
